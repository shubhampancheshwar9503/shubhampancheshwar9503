#### **Overview**
This repository presents a robust and scalable Selenium Automation Testing Framework, meticulously designed to streamline the testing process for web applications. The framework adheres to industry standards, integrating modern tools and methodologies such as Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Maven, and Page Object Model (POM) to deliver precise and reliable test results. It incorporates both functional and regression testing techniques, enabling seamless integration of automation and manual testing practices.

By leveraging technologies like Core Java, HTML5, Microsoft Excel, SQL, and Jira, the framework ensures a comprehensive testing solution for frontend and backend systems. This repository is a valuable resource for developers and testers looking to enhance their testing capabilities and ensure high-quality software delivery.

#### **Key Features**

1. **Selenium WebDriver**  
   - Automates browser interactions for precise end-to-end testing.  
   - Supports cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).  

2. **TestNG Integration**  
   - Simplifies test execution through annotations, parallel testing, and XML configuration.  
   - Generates structured test reports with detailed logs.

3. **Maven Build Tool**  
   - Simplifies dependency management and builds processes.  
   - Ensures smooth project setup and execution with minimal manual intervention.  

4. **Page Object Model (POM)**  
   - Reduces code duplication and increases maintainability by separating web element locators from test logic.  

5. **Data-Driven Testing**  
   - Enables testing with multiple datasets using Microsoft Excel.  
   - Validates different scenarios efficiently without altering test scripts.

6. **Regression Testing**  
   - Verifies application stability after updates or enhancements.  
   - Automates repetitive tests to save time and improve accuracy.  

7. **Core Java Implementation**  
   - Uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to build robust and reusable test cases.  

8. **Manual Testing Support**  
   - Complements automation with exploratory and edge-case testing.  
   - Documents detailed test cases, bug reports, and strategies.

9. **Backend Testing with SQL**  
   - Validates data integrity and consistency in relational databases.  
   - Includes queries for CRUD operations, data validations, and performance checks.

10. **Jira Integration**  
    - Tracks issues, records bugs, and facilitates collaboration with developers.  
    - Links test cases to bugs for better traceability.

#### **Project Structure**

1. **Configuration Files**  
   - `config.properties`: Centralized storage for environment variables like base URLs, credentials, and browser configurations.  
   - `log4j.properties`: Configures logging for error tracking and debugging.  

2. **Test Scripts**  
   - Organized into functional modules, e.g., login, registration, search functionality, and form validation.  
   - Each script uses POM classes for web interactions.  

3. **Utilities**  
   - **Excel Utility**: Reads test data from Excel sheets for parameterized testing.  
   - **Report Utility**: Generates interactive reports post-execution.  
   - **Browser Factory**: Manages browser initialization and teardown.  

4. **POM Classes**  
   - Encapsulate web element locators and methods for each page.  
   - Ensure modularity and reusability of code.  

5. **TestNG Configuration**  
   - XML files for grouping, prioritizing, and executing test cases.  
   - Supports parallel execution for faster test cycles.

#### **Core Test Scenarios**

1. **Login Functionality**  
   - Verify login with valid and invalid credentials.  
   - Validate error messages for incorrect inputs.

2. **Search Functionality**  
   - Test search results for valid and invalid keywords.  
   - Check result count and relevance.

3. **Registration Workflow**  
   - Validate required fields, input constraints, and form submission.  

4. **Regression Testing**  
   - Automate critical workflows like checkout, payment, and order history in e-commerce applications.  

5. **Data Validation**  
   - Use SQL queries to validate data consistency post-testing.
